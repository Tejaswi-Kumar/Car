# Car Recommendation System

The project is based on recommending the best set of cars to the user from the available list of cars.
The list of cars are scraped from a site and is stored in mongodb.
The front end interface was designed using HTML.
The algorithm used was AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) to recommend the best set of cars to the user.
Java is used to run and connect the data from Mongodb and to process the preferences set by the user.
